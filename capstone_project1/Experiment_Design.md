The goal of the experiment is to determine if nhl draft order has an impact on team performance during the following season. 
    - Draft order will be examined with regard to what position the draftee plays
        - players can have one of three main positions: defense, forward, goalie
        - players who are picked earlier in the draft are work more points
        - The study will analyze total points for a position aggregated at the team level
    - team performance will be examined with regard to percent change in wins over the previous season

We will seek to test dependence between position drafting and season performance using a chi-squared test:
    - performance: increase in win percent vs. decrease in win percent
    - position drafting: drafted goalies early, drafted defenders early, drafted forwards early
